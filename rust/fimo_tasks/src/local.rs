/// A task-specific storage key which owns its contents.
///
/// It is instantiated with the [`task_specific`] macro and the primary method is the
/// [`with`](TssKey::with) method, though there are helpers to make working with
/// [`Cell`](std::cell::Cell) types easier.
///
/// The [`with`](TssKey::with) method yields a reference to the contained value which cannot outlive
/// the current task or escape the given closure.
///
/// # Initialization and Destruction
///
/// Initialization is dynamically performed on the first call to a setter (e.g.
/// [`with`](TssKey::with)) within a task, and values that implement [`Drop`] get destructed when a
/// task exits.
///
/// A `TssKey`'s initializer cannot recursively depend on itself. Using a `TssKey` in this way may
/// cause panics, aborts or infinite recursion on the first call to [`with`](TssKey::with).
///
/// # Single-thread Synchronization
///
/// Though there is no potential race with other threads, it is still possible to obtain multiple
/// references to the task-specific data in different places on the call stack. For this reason,
/// only shared (`&T`) references may be obtained.
///
/// To allow obtaining an exclusive mutable reference (`&mut T`), typically a
/// [`Cell`](std::cell::Cell) or [`RefCell`](std::cell::RefCell) is used (see [`std::cell`] for more
/// information on how exactly this works). To make this easier there are specialized
/// implementations for `TssKey<Cell<T>>` and `TssKey<RefCell<T>>`.
